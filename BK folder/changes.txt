TODO (before re-submitting): 

-First comment referee M not addressed.
-Tag 023T should everywhere be replaced by Tag 023R.
-I did not phrase the sentence “Recall …” correctly. It should say RHS instead of LHS. Also, it should say: arbitrary closed subschemes of $\widehat{\C}_0^3$ obtained by adding n embedded points to $\widehat{Z}_{\lambda\mu\nu}$ by (4).
-Remark 19: in formula Behrend sign: I forgot to write \dim and it is also better to write T_[Z] H in order to be more consistent with notation elsewhere in the paper (and just leave out P).
